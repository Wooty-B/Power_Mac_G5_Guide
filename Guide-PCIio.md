## PCI & PCI-X I/O Cards

This section covers known working cards for OS X and Linux, as well as some useful notes. If you have any cards that have been tested working/not working please reach out using the Issue tracker so I can update this list.

NOTE: I am working on obtaining an older working unit to test on, so currently I am unable to comment on cards at this time. If anyone has tested cards working, let me know so I can add them!

### USB 2.0
    
NOTE: USB 2.0 cards manufactured in the 2000's generally work under OS X and Linux without issues.

### SATA I/II
