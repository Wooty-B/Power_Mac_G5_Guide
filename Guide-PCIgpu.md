## AGP GPU Cards

This section covers known working GPU's for OS X and Linux, as well as some useful notes. If you have any cards that have been tested working/not working please reach out using the Issue tracker so I can update this list.

NOTE: Cards that are marked "Windows Flash" means you can flash a modified BIOS to the card in order to get it working on PowerPC Mac's. Card marked with "Mac Version" mean this was an option offered by Apple or as a retail purchase, these versions working out-of-the-box with the G5. Must be a Mac Version, or else will need to be flashed.
