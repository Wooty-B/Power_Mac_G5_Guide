## PCIe I/O Cards

This section covers known working cards for OS X and Linux, as well as some useful notes. If you have any cards that have been tested working/not working please reach out using the Issue tracker so I can update this list.

    NOTE: The G5's with PCIe use PCIe Gen 1, meaning you may need to be careful about bandwidth and backwards compatability when obtaining a card.

USB 2.0
    NOTE: USB 2.0 cards manufactured in the 2000's generally work under OS X and Linux without issues.

USB 3.0+
    NOTE: USB 3.0 cards DO NOT work under OS X, however some work under Linux.
    NOTE: If purchasing a USB 3.0 card for Linux use, be sure it has a USB 3.0 controller supported under Linux, as not all USB 3.0 cards will work.


SATA II/III
    NOTE: SATA II/III cards manufactured in the 2000's generally work under OS X and Linux without issues.

nVME
    NOTE: nVME cards DO NOT work under OS X, however most should work under Linux.
